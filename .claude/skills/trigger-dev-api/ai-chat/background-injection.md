# Background injection

> Source: https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/background-injection

The AI Agents and Prompts surface ships as part of the **v4.5 release candidate**. Install with `@trigger.dev/sdk@rc` (or pin `4.5.0-rc.0` or later) to use these features — they aren’t yet on the latest stable, and APIs may still change before the 4.5.0 GA. See [supported AI SDK versions](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/reference#compatibility)
 and the [AI chat changelog](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/changelog)
 for details.

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`chat.inject()` queues model messages for injection into the conversation. Messages are picked up at the start of the next turn or at the next `prepareStep` boundary (between tool-call steps). This is the backend counterpart to [pending messages](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/pending-messages)
 — pending messages come from the user via the frontend, while `chat.inject()` comes from your task code.

Basic usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    import { chat } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/ai";
    
    // Queue a system message for injection
    chat.inject([\
      {\
        role: "system",\
        content: "The user's account was just upgraded to Pro.",\
      },\
    ]);
    

Messages are appended to the model messages before the next LLM inference call. The LLM sees them as part of the conversation context.

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/background-injection#common-pattern-defer-+-inject)

Common pattern: defer + inject
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most powerful pattern combines `chat.defer()` (background work) with `chat.inject()` (inject results). Background work runs in parallel with the idle wait between turns, and results are injected before the next response.

    export const myChat = chat.agent({
      id: "my-chat",
      onTurnComplete: async ({ messages }) => {
        // Kick off background analysis — doesn't block the turn
        chat.defer(
          (async () => {
            const analysis = await analyzeConversation(messages);
            chat.inject([\
              {\
                role: "system",\
                content: `[Analysis of conversation so far]\n\n${analysis}`,\
              },\
            ]);
          })()
        );
      },
      run: async ({ messages, signal }) => {
        return streamText({
          ...chat.toStreamTextOptions({ registry }),
          messages,
          abortSignal: signal,
          stopWhen: stepCountIs(15),
        });
      },
    });

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/background-injection#timing)

Timing

1.  Turn completes, `onTurnComplete` fires
2.  `chat.defer()` registers the background work
3.  The run immediately starts waiting for the next message (no blocking)
4.  Background work completes, `chat.inject()` queues the messages
5.  User sends next message, turn starts
6.  Injected messages are appended before `run()` executes
7.  The LLM sees the injected context alongside the new user message

If the background work finishes _during_ a tool-call loop (not between turns), the messages are picked up at the next `prepareStep` boundary instead.

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/background-injection#example-self-review)

Example: self-review
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A cheap model reviews the agent’s response after each turn and injects coaching for the next one. Uses [Prompts](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai/prompts)
 for the review prompt and `generateObject` for structured output.

    import { chat } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/ai";
    import { prompts } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
    import { streamText, generateObject, createProviderRegistry, stepCountIs } from "ai";
    import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
    import { z } from "zod";
    
    const registry = createProviderRegistry({ anthropic });
    
    const selfReviewPrompt = prompts.define({
      id: "self-review",
      model: "anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5",
      content: `You are a conversation quality reviewer. Analyze the assistant's most recent response.
    
    Focus on:
    - Whether the response answered the user's question
    - Missed opportunities to use tools or provide more detail
    - Tone mismatches
    
    Be concise. Only flag issues worth fixing.`,
    });
    
    export const myChat = chat.agent({
      id: "my-chat",
      onTurnComplete: async ({ messages }) => {
        chat.defer(
          (async () => {
            const resolved = await selfReviewPrompt.resolve({});
    
            const review = await generateObject({
              model: registry.languageModel(resolved.model ?? "anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5"),
              ...resolved.toAISDKTelemetry(),
              system: resolved.text,
              prompt: messages
                .filter((m) => m.role === "user" || m.role === "assistant")
                .map((m) => {
                  const text =
                    typeof m.content === "string"
                      ? m.content
                      : Array.isArray(m.content)
                        ? m.content
                            .filter((p: any) => p.type === "text")
                            .map((p: any) => p.text)
                            .join("")
                        : "";
                  return `${m.role}: ${text}`;
                })
                .join("\n\n"),
              schema: z.object({
                needsImprovement: z.boolean(),
                suggestions: z.array(z.string()),
              }),
            });
    
            if (review.object.needsImprovement) {
              chat.inject([\
                {\
                  role: "system",\
                  content: `[Self-review]\n\n${review.object.suggestions.map((s) => `- ${s}`).join("\n")}\n\nApply these naturally.`,\
                },\
              ]);
            }
          })()
        );
      },
      run: async ({ messages, signal }) => {
        return streamText({
          ...chat.toStreamTextOptions({ registry }),
          messages,
          abortSignal: signal,
          stopWhen: stepCountIs(15),
        });
      },
    });
    

The self-review runs on `claude-haiku-4-5` (fast, cheap) in the background. If the user sends another message before it completes, the coaching is still injected — `chat.inject()` persists across the idle wait.

Other use cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **RAG augmentation**: After each turn, fetch relevant documents and inject them as context for the next response
*   **Safety checks**: Run a moderation model on the response, inject warnings if issues are detected
*   **Fact-checking**: Verify claims in the response using search tools, inject corrections
*   **Context enrichment**: Look up user/account data based on what was discussed, inject it as system context

`chat.defer` standalone
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`chat.defer()` is also useful on its own, without `chat.inject()`. Any work whose timing has no resume implication — analytics, audit logs, search-index writes, cache warming — can run in parallel with streaming instead of in the critical path. All deferred promises are awaited (with a 5s timeout) before `onTurnComplete` fires.

    export const myChat = chat.agent({
      id: "my-chat",
      onTurnStart: async ({ chatId, runId }) => {
        // Analytics — fire-and-forget, irrelevant to resume.
        chat.defer(analytics.track("turn_started", { chatId, runId }));
      },
      run: async ({ messages, signal }) => {
        return streamText({ model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-5"), messages, abortSignal: signal });
      },
    });
    

`chat.defer()` can be called from anywhere during a turn — hooks, `run()`, or nested helpers. All deferred promises are collected and awaited together before `onTurnComplete`.

**Don’t use `chat.defer()` for the message-history write in `onTurnStart`.** That write must land _before_ the model starts streaming, otherwise a mid-stream page refresh will read `[]` from your DB and lose the user’s message from the rendered conversation. See [Database persistence — `onTurnStart`](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/database-persistence#onturnstart)
. Reserve `chat.defer` for writes whose timing has no resume implication.

How it differs from pending messages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|     | `chat.inject()` | [Pending messages](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/pending-messages) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source** | Backend task code | Frontend user input |
| **Triggered by** | Your code (e.g. `onTurnComplete` + `chat.defer()`) | User sending a message during streaming |
| **Injection point** | Start of next turn, or next `prepareStep` boundary | Next `prepareStep` boundary only |
| **Message role** | Any (`system`, `user`, `assistant`) | Typically `user` |
| **Frontend visibility** | Not visible unless you write custom `data-*` chunks | Visible via `usePendingMessages` hook |

chat.inject()

    chat.inject(messages: ModelMessage[]): void
    

Queue model messages for injection at the next opportunity. Messages persist across the idle wait between turns — they are not reset when a new turn starts. **Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messages` | `ModelMessage[]` | Model messages to inject (from the `ai` package) |

Messages are drained (consumed) when:

1.  A new turn starts — before `run()` executes
2.  A `prepareStep` boundary is reached — between tool-call steps during streaming

`chat.inject()` writes to an in-memory queue in the current process. It works from any code running in the same task — lifecycle hooks, deferred work, tool execute functions, etc. It does not work from subtasks or other runs.
