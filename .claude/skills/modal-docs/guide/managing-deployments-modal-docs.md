Managing deployments
====================

Once you’ve finished using `modal run` or `modal serve` to iterate on your Modal code, it’s time to deploy. A Modal deployment creates and then persists an App and its objects, providing the following benefits:

*   Repeated executions of the App’s Functions will be grouped under the Deployment, aiding observability and usage tracking. Programmatically triggering lots of ephemeral App runs can clutter your web and CLI interfaces.
*   Function calls are much faster because deployed Functions are persistent and reused, not created on-demand by calls. Learn how to trigger deployed Functions in [Invoking deployed Functions](https://modal.com/docs/guide/trigger-deployed-functions)
    .
*   [Scheduled Functions](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cron)
     will continue scheduling separate from any local iteration you do, and will notify you on failure.
*   [Web Functions](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks)
     keep running when you close your laptop, and their URL address matches the deployment name.

Creating deployments 

Deployments are created using the [`modal deploy`](https://modal.com/docs/cli/latest/deploy)
 command.

     % modal deploy -m whisper_pod_transcriber.main
    ✓ Initialized. View app page at https://modal.com/apps/ap-PYc2Tb7JrkskFUI8U5w0KG.

Running this command on an existing deployment will redeploy the App, incrementing its version. For detail on how live deployed Apps transition between versions, see the [Updating deployments](https://modal.com/docs/guide/managing-deployments#updating-deployments)
 section.

Deployments can also be created programmatically using the [`app.deploy()`](https://modal.com/docs/sdk/py/latest/modal.App#deploy)
 method in Modal’s Python SDK.

Viewing deployments 

Deployments can be viewed in the [web UI](https://modal.com/apps)
 on an App’s “Deployment History” page, or from the command line using the [`modal app list`](https://modal.com/docs/cli/latest/app#modal-app-list)
 command.

### Deployment events on charts 

You can overlay deployment history information on your Function’s metric charts by enabling the **Show Deployments** toggle. Each marker represents one or more deployments that occurred within a time bucket.

Hovering over a marker shows the version number and timestamp of each deployment, plus a link to the full “Deployment History” page.

Updating deployments 

A deployment can create a new App or redeploy an existing deployed App with a new version. It’s useful to understand how Modal handles the transition between versions when an App is redeployed. In general, Modal aims to support zero-downtime deployments by gradually transitioning traffic to the new version, but it is also possible to opt into a sharp cutover between versions.

If the deployment involves building new versions of the Images used by the App, the build process will need to complete successfully before any new containers are started. The existing version of the App will continue to handle inputs during this time. Errors during the build will abort the deployment with no change to the status of the App.

### Deployment strategies 

After the build completes, Modal will start to bring up new containers running the latest version of the App. The exact mechanics depend on the choice of deployment strategy, configured with `--strategy` in the [`modal deploy`](https://modal.com/docs/cli/latest/deploy)
 CLI or `strategy=` in the [`app.deploy()`](https://modal.com/docs/sdk/py/latest/modal.App#deploy)
 method.

With the default `rolling` strategy, existing containers will continue handling inputs (using the previous version of the App) until new containers have completed their cold start. Traffic will shift over to these new containers as they come online, but old containers will not shut down until they finish processing any inputs they were assigned.

With the opt-in `recreate` strategy, the transition between versions will be more abrupt. Existing containers will be terminated as soon as the new version is active, and inputs will queue until new containers come online (including inputs that were running on old containers, which will be retried on new ones).

The `rolling` strategy avoids downtime and is recommended for any production Apps. The `recreate` strategy is primarily useful during development, because you can be certain that new containers will be used for any inputs sent after the deployment command returns.

No-op deployments and rollovers 

The App is the unit of deployment. If nothing in the App configuration has changed, the deployment command will be a no-op, and the App version will not increment. However, changes to any Function will cause all Functions to update.

It’s possible to cycle the containers serving an App without any changes to the code or configuration by using the [`modal app rollover`](https://modal.com/docs/cli/latest/app#modal-app-rollover)
 command. This may be necessary if the App depends on a Secret or some other external resource that is loaded at container startup and has become invalidated. A rollover event will appear in the deployment history as a new version. As with a normal deployment, a rollover can be performed with either a `rolling` or `recreate` strategy.

Deployment rollbacks 

To quickly reset an App back to a previous version (e.g., if you discover that a new version has a serious defect), you can perform a deployment _rollback_. Rollbacks can be triggered from the Deployment History tab in the App dashboard or using the [`modal app rollback`](https://modal.com/docs/cli/latest/app#modal-app-rollback)
 CLI. Rollback deployments look like new deployments: they increment the version number and are attributed to the user who triggered the rollback. But the App’s Functions and metadata will be reset to their previous state independently of your current App codebase.

Stopping deployments 

Deployed Apps can be stopped in the web UI by clicking the red “Stop app” button on the App’s “Overview” page, or alternatively from the command line using the [`modal app stop`](https://modal.com/docs/cli/latest/app#modal-app-stop)
 command.

Stopping an App is a destructive action. Apps cannot be restarted from this state; a new App will need to be deployed from the same source files. Objects associated with stopped deployments will eventually be garbage collected.
