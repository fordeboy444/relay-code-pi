modal.Retries
=============

    class Retries(object)

Adds a retry policy to a Modal function.

**Usage**

    import modal
    app = modal.App()
    
    # Basic configuration.
    # This sets a policy of max 4 retries with 1-second delay between failures.
    @app.function(retries=4)
    def f():
        pass
    
    
    # Fixed-interval retries with 3-second delay between failures.
    @app.function(
        retries=modal.Retries(
            max_retries=2,
            backoff_coefficient=1.0,
            initial_delay=3.0,
        )
    )
    def g():
        pass
    
    
    # Exponential backoff, with retry delay doubling after each failure.
    @app.function(
        retries=modal.Retries(
            max_retries=4,
            backoff_coefficient=2.0,
            initial_delay=1.0,
        )
    )
    def h():
        pass

    __init__(self, *, max_retries, backoff_coefficient=2.0, initial_delay=1.0,
        max_delay=60.0)

Construct a new retries policy, supporting exponential and fixed-interval delays via a backoff coefficient.

**Parameters**

max_retries int

Maximum number of retries after failures.

backoff_coefficient float

Multiplier applied to the delay after each attempt; `1.0` means fixed delay. (Default is 2.0)

initial_delay float

Seconds before the first retry. (Default is 1.0)

max_delay float

Upper cap on the delay between retries (seconds). (Default is 60.0)
