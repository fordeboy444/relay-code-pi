Concurrency limits
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Pricing tier | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Free | 10 concurrent runs |
| Hobby | 25 concurrent runs |
| Pro | 100+ concurrent runs |

Extra concurrency above the Pro tier limit is available via the dashboard. Click the “Concurrency” page from the left sidebar when on the Pro plan to purchase more.

Rate limits
---------------------------------------------------------------

Generally speaking each SDK call is an API call.

| Limit | Details |
| --- | --- |
| API | 1,500 requests per minute |

You can request a higher rate limit from us if you’re on a paid plan. The most common cause of hitting the API rate limit is if you’re calling `trigger()` on a task in a loop, instead of doing this use `batchTrigger()` which will trigger multiple tasks in a single API call. You can have up to 1,000 tasks in a single batch trigger call with SDK 4.3.1+ (500 in prior versions).

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/limits#queued-tasks)

Queued tasks
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The maximum number of runs that can be queued **per queue** (not across all queues in the environment). Each queue can hold up to its limit independently. When a queue hits its limit, new triggers to that queue are rejected.

The limits below apply to [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://trigger.dev/)
. If you self-host Trigger.dev, queue size limits are configurable via the `MAXIMUM_DEV_QUEUE_SIZE` and `MAXIMUM_DEPLOYED_QUEUE_SIZE` environment variables — see [Self-hosting environment variables](https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/env/webapp#run-engine)
.

| Pricing tier | Development (per queue) | Staging / Production (per queue) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 500 | 10,000 |
| Hobby | 500 | 250,000 |
| Pro | 5,000 | 1,000,000 |

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/limits#maximum-run-ttl)

Maximum run TTL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On Trigger.dev Cloud, all runs have an enforced maximum TTL of 14 days. Runs without an explicit TTL automatically receive the 14-day TTL; runs with a TTL longer than 14 days are clamped to 14 days. This prevents queued runs from accumulating indefinitely. If you self-host, you can configure a maximum TTL via the `RUN_ENGINE_DEFAULT_MAX_TTL` environment variable — see [Self-hosting environment variables](https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/env/webapp#run-engine)
.

Schedules
-----------------------------------------------------------

| Pricing tier | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Free | 10 per project |
| Hobby | 100 per project |
| Pro | 1,000+ per project |

Additional bundles above the Pro tier are available for $10/month per 1,000 schedules. Contact us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact)
 or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord)
 to request more. When attaching schedules to tasks we strongly recommend you add them [in our dashboard](https://trigger.dev/docs/tasks/scheduled#attaching-schedules-in-the-dashboard)
 if they’re “static”. That way you can control them easily per environment. If you add them [dynamically using code](https://trigger.dev/docs/management/schedules/create)
 make sure you add a `deduplicationKey` so you don’t add the same schedule to a task multiple times. If you don’t your task will get triggered multiple times, it will cost you more, and you will hit the limit. If you’re creating schedules for your user you will definitely need to request more schedules from us.

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/limits#projects)

Projects
---------------------------------------------------------

| Pricing tier | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| All tiers | 10 per organization |

Each project receives its own concurrency allocation. If you need to support multiple tenants with the same codebase but different environment variables, see the [Multi-tenant applications](https://trigger.dev/docs/deploy-environment-variables#multi-tenant-applications)
 section for a recommended workaround.

Preview branches
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Pricing tier | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Free | Not available |
| Hobby | 5 preview branches |
| Pro | 20+ preview branches |

Additional bundles above the Pro tier are available for $10/month per preview branch. Contact us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact)
 or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord)
 to request more.

Realtime connections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Pricing tier | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Free | 10 concurrent connections |
| Hobby | 50 concurrent connections |
| Pro | 500+ concurrent connections |

Additional bundles are available for $10/month per 100 concurrent connections. Contact us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact)

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/limits#task-payloads-and-outputs)

Task payloads and outputs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Limit | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Single trigger payload | Must not exceed 3MB |
| Batch trigger payload | Each item can be up to 3MB (SDK 4.3.1+). Prior: 1MB total combined |
| Task outputs | Must not exceed 10MB |

Payloads and outputs that exceed 512KB will be offloaded to object storage and a presigned URL will be provided to download the data when calling `runs.retrieve`. You don’t need to do anything to handle this in your tasks however, as we will transparently upload/download these during operation.

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/limits#batch-size)

Batch size
-------------------------------------------------------------

A single batch can have a maximum of 1,000 items with SDK 4.3.1+. Prior versions are limited to 500 items.

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/limits#batch-trigger-rate-limits)

Batch trigger rate limits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Batch triggering uses a token bucket algorithm to rate limit the number of runs you can trigger per environment. Each run in a batch consumes one token.

| Pricing tier | Bucket size | Refill rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 1,200 runs | 100 runs every 10 sec |
| Hobby | 5,000 runs | 500 runs every 5 sec |
| Pro | 5,000 runs | 500 runs every 5 sec |

**How it works**: You can burst up to your bucket size, then tokens refill at the specified rate. For example, a Free user can trigger 1,200 runs immediately, then must wait for tokens to refill (100 runs become available every 10 seconds).

When you hit batch rate limits, the SDK throws a `BatchTriggerError` with `isRateLimited: true`. See [Handling batch trigger errors](https://trigger.dev/docs/triggering#handling-batch-trigger-errors)
 for how to detect and react to rate limits in your code.

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/limits#batch-trigger-processing-concurrency)

Batch trigger processing concurrency
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you send a batch trigger, we convert it into individual runs. This limit controls the maximum number of batches being converted into runs simultaneously per environment. It is not a limit on how many batch runs can be executing at once.

| Pricing tier | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Free | 5 concurrent batches |
| Hobby | 10 concurrent batches |
| Pro | 50 concurrent batches |

Machines
---------------------------------------------------------

The default machine is `small-1x` which has 0.5 vCPU and 0.5 GB of RAM. You can optionally configure a higher spec machine which will increase the cost of running the task but can also improve the performance of the task if it is CPU or memory bound. See the [machine configurations](https://trigger.dev/docs/machines#machine-configurations)
 for more details.
