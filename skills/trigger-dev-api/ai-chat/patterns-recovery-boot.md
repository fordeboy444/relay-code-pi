# Recovery boot

> Source: https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/recovery-boot

The AI Agents and Prompts surface ships as part of the **v4.5 release candidate**. Install with `@trigger.dev/sdk@rc` (or pin `4.5.0-rc.0` or later) to use these features — they aren’t yet on the latest stable, and APIs may still change before the 4.5.0 GA. See [supported AI SDK versions](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/reference#compatibility)
 and the [AI chat changelog](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/changelog)
 for details.

When a `chat.agent` run dies in the middle of streaming a response — the user cancels, the worker OOMs, or an unhandled exception kills the process — the durable streams hold what was in flight. The next run boots as a continuation, reads both stream tails, and reconstructs a chain that preserves the partial response so any follow-up (`keep going`, `actually do X instead`, a new question) has full context. The behavior is automatic. The `onRecoveryBoot` hook is opt-in for policies that need something different.

The scenario
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // Turn 1 is mid-essay when the user clicks Cancel.
    window.__chat.send("Write me a long essay about espresso");
    // ... assistant has written 3000 characters ...
    window.__chat.stop();                              // OR: server-side cancel_run
    
    // User decides what they want next.
    window.__chat.send("keep going");                  // OR: "what's 7+8?", or anything
    

The cancelled run never wrote `onTurnComplete`. The snapshot is stale or absent. `session.out` has a half-written assistant message. `session.in` has the original user message (the run consumed it but never marked the turn complete) plus the new follow-up. A naive continuation would either re-run the cancelled essay (the user already chose to stop) or drop everything (no context for the follow-up). Recovery boot handles this without either failure mode.

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/recovery-boot#the-smart-default)

The smart default
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a continuation boot, the runtime reads:

*   **Snapshot** — settled turns persisted by the last successful `onTurnComplete`.
*   **`session.out` tail past the snapshot cursor** — closed assistant turns plus, optionally, a `partialAssistant` (the trailing message whose stream never received a `finish` chunk). `cleanupAbortedParts` has already stripped streaming-in-progress fragments.
*   **`session.in` tail past the last `turn-complete` cursor** — user messages the dead run hadn’t acknowledged.

If both `partialAssistant` and `inFlightUsers` are non-empty, the runtime splices `[firstInFlightUser, partialAssistant]` onto the chain. The remaining in-flight users dispatch as fresh turns. The model sees:

    [ ...settledMessages,  // chain through the last completed turn\
      firstInFlightUser,   // the question the dead run was answering\
      partialAssistant,    // the dead run's incomplete response\
      followUpUser ]       // the new turn the customer just sent
    

Modern instruction-following models prioritize the latest user message. The follow-up determines the response:

| Follow-up | Model behavior |
| --- | --- |
| ”keep going” / “continue” / “more” | Continues the partial essay from where it stopped. |
| ”actually, what’s 7+8?” | Answers the new question. Prior context doesn’t derail it. |
| ”scrap that, do something else” | Abandons the partial work and follows the new direction. |

No customer code needed for any of these.

When to register `onRecoveryBoot`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The hook fires when recovery state is non-empty (either `partialAssistant` is defined or there’s at least one in-flight user). Register it when you need a policy different from “preserve context”:

*   **Drop the partial entirely.** Your UX means “cancel discards the work — start fresh from the follow-up.”
*   **Synthesize tool results.** The partial has tool calls in `input-available` state (HITL was mid-call when the run died). Return a chain that has fabricated `output-available` results so the model can continue.
*   **Emit a recovery banner.** Write a `data-chat-recovery` UIMessage chunk via `ctx.writer` so the frontend can render “Recovering interrupted response…” before the model speaks.
*   **Persist recovered state.** Use `beforeBoot` to flush the partial to your own database before the next turn starts.

    import { chat } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/ai";
    
    export const myChat = chat.agent({
      id: "my-chat",
      onRecoveryBoot: async ({ partialAssistant, inFlightUsers, writer, cause, previousRunId }) => {
        writer.write({
          type: "data-chat-recovery",
          data: { cause, previousRunId, partialPresent: partialAssistant !== undefined },
          transient: true,
        });
        // Return nothing → fall through to smart default.
      },
      run: async ({ messages, signal }) =>
        streamText({ model, messages, abortSignal: signal }),
    });

Hook reference
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/recovery-boot#fires-when)

Fires when

The hook fires once on a continuation boot, AFTER both stream tails have been read, AND only when there’s a partial assistant — the mid-stream-died signal:

    const shouldFire = partialAssistant !== undefined;
    

In-flight users alone don’t fire the hook. Graceful exits like `chat.requestUpgrade()` and `chat.endRun()` may leave an unacknowledged user on `session.in` (the message that triggered the upgrade, the next message after endRun), but no partial — that’s a normal continuation, not recovery. The next message just dispatches as turn 1 on the new run via the normal session.in pump. Skipped scenarios (where the hook does NOT fire):

*   A clean continuation after `chat.endRun()` with no buffered follow-up.
*   A fresh chat (no continuation, attempt 1).
*   An OOM retry that booted onto a complete snapshot (no partial on the tail).
*   `chat.requestUpgrade()` graceful exit — predecessor ended cleanly before processing, no partial.
*   An agent with [`hydrateMessages`](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/lifecycle-hooks#hydratemessages)
     registered. Customers using `hydrateMessages` own persistence — recovery decisions live in their own DB query.

Event shape

    type RecoveryBootEvent<TUIM extends UIMessage = UIMessage> = {
      ctx: TaskRunContext;
      chatId: string;
      runId: string;
      previousRunId: string;
      cause: "cancelled" | "crashed" | "unknown";
      settledMessages: TUIM[];
      inFlightUsers: TUIM[];
      partialAssistant: TUIM | undefined;
      pendingToolCalls: Array<{
        toolCallId: string;
        toolName: string;
        input: unknown;
        partIndex: number;
      }>;
      writer: ChatWriter;
    };
    

`cause` is currently always `"unknown"` — the run engine doesn’t yet plumb the real reason into the continuation payload. The enum is forward-looking; don’t branch behavior on it for now.

### 

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/recovery-boot#return-shape)

Return shape

Every field is optional. Returning `undefined` (or nothing) accepts the smart default for every field.

    type RecoveryBootResult<TUIM extends UIMessage = UIMessage> = {
      chain?: TUIM[];
      recoveredTurns?: TUIM[];
      beforeBoot?: () => Promise<void>;
    };
    

*   **`chain`** — replaces the seed chain. Defaults to `[...settledMessages, firstInFlightUser, partialAssistant]` when both partial and in-flight users exist, otherwise `settledMessages` alone.
*   **`recoveredTurns`** — user messages to dispatch as fresh turns after the chain is restored. Defaults to `inFlightUsers.slice(1)` when the smart default consumed the first user, otherwise `inFlightUsers`.
*   **`beforeBoot`** — runs after the writer flushes and before the first recovered turn fires. Use for blocking persistence (write the partial to your DB so a later turn can reference it). Errors bubble — wrap your own try/catch if you want to soft-fail.

Drop the partial — strict “cancel means discard”

The customer’s UX treats cancel as “throw the work away”:

    onRecoveryBoot: async ({ inFlightUsers, partialAssistant }) => {
      if (!partialAssistant) return;          // No partial → nothing to drop
      return {
        chain: undefined,                      // Use settledMessages, don't splice partial
        recoveredTurns: inFlightUsers.slice(1) // Still skip the first user (the dead run was answering it)
      };
    }

Synthesize tool results for a mid-call interruption

The dead run was processing a tool call when it died. The partial has tool parts in `input-available` state with no `output-available`. Synthesize a result so the model can keep going:

    onRecoveryBoot: async ({ partialAssistant, pendingToolCalls, settledMessages, inFlightUsers }) => {
      if (pendingToolCalls.length === 0) return;
    
      // Rebuild the partial with synthetic outputs for any input-available tool call.
      const repaired = {
        ...partialAssistant!,
        parts: partialAssistant!.parts!.map((part, i) => {
          const pending = pendingToolCalls.find(p => p.partIndex === i);
          if (!pending) return part;
          return {
            ...part,
            state: "output-available" as const,
            output: { interrupted: true, reason: "previous run was cancelled" },
          };
        }),
      };
    
      return {
        chain: [...settledMessages, inFlightUsers[0]!, repaired],
        recoveredTurns: inFlightUsers.slice(1),
      };
    }

Persist the partial before the next turn fires

      return {
        beforeBoot: async () => {
          if (partialAssistant) {
            await db.partial.create({

            });

Interaction with other features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/recovery-boot#hydratemessages)

`hydrateMessages`

If your agent registers [`hydrateMessages`](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/lifecycle-hooks#hydratemessages)
, the runtime skips snapshot read, `session.out` replay, `session.in` replay, AND `onRecoveryBoot`. Your DB is the source of truth — recovery decisions live in your own query. To detect a cancel-recovery scenario yourself, persist a `runState: "in-progress"` flag in `onTurnStart` and check for it in `hydrateMessages`.

### 

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/recovery-boot#chat-requestupgrade)

`chat.requestUpgrade()`

[`chat.requestUpgrade()`](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/version-upgrades)
 is a graceful exit — the old run doesn’t crash, it returns cleanly. The new continuation run boots with a clean `session.out` tail (`partialAssistant` is undefined) and the upgrade-trigger message on `session.in` (one in-flight user). The smart default doesn’t splice (it requires both partial AND in-flight users), so the chain is just `settledMessages` and the in-flight user dispatches as a fresh turn. `onRecoveryBoot` still fires (there’s an in-flight user) — use it to emit an “upgraded” signal to the UI if you want.

### 

[​](https://trigger.dev/docs/ai-chat/patterns/recovery-boot#hooks-throwing)

Hooks throwing

If the body of `onRecoveryBoot` throws (or rejects), the runtime logs a warning and falls back to the smart default — the run does not fail. Wrap your own try/catch if you want stricter handling. `beforeBoot` is the exception: it’s the contract you opted into for blocking persistence, so errors thrown there **bubble** and fail the run rather than dispatch recovered turns against half-persisted state. Wrap it yourself if you want to soft-fail.
